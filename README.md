SPIMI, inverted index, Data Compression Course Assignment

Thanks to longmenwaideyu. Very neat and well-structed code, easy to understand.<br/>
His solution can roughly fit into this assignment. This would save me a lot of time.<br/>
But this project still need to be modified, some of the major changes would be:<br/>
1. different doc identificaton and tokenization
2. some stemming to be added
3. may change gamma code to variant byte to ease the computation consumption, dict and idx format may change accordingly
4. keyword search to be added and ranking to be added
